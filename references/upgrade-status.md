# V1.1.0: implemented behavior and limits

## Implemented

- Separate symbolic notation identity, written occurrences and a monotone piecewise performance map; explicit playback order, voice/hand assignment and real layout coordinates. Preserve rests, chord members, accidentals as encoded by checked XML, ties and slurs. No guessed accompaniment or automatic filling.
- Evidence-bound original-source coverage inventory and explicit excerpt mapping. This checks declared scope, not OCR correctness or pitch correspondence.
- Unapproved review worksheet with original source, original audio, all written notes and separately entered observations. Candidate-only worksheets retain null final map identity and an unresolved blocker.
- Formal audible jobs recompute full human content/time review, source scope where needed, and all input hashes. No approval from three onsets, DTW, a passed summary or an Agent-generated review. Freeze underlying evidence and reachable code. A local JSON declaration is not identity authentication.
- Configuration confirmation, first-four direction review plus full-song risk positions, portrait/landscape presets, grand-staff-centered dynamic pivot, Smoothstep system changes, paper/dark/custom backgrounds, palette indicators, title and avatar layering. Existing default rendering is retained when aspect is omitted.
- Decoded output/master audio preservation check. This tests transport, not musical correctness.

## Partially implemented / experimental

- Local NumPy/FFmpeg pitch/chroma DTW plus short-window attack candidates and a monotone attack edit path. It proposes segment/note timing, retains coarse DTW separately, and exposes unmatched score/audio attacks. It can misalign repeats, soft attacks, legato or dense chords. All results remain needs_review.
- Pitch ranking and per-measure spectral costs help locate doubts. They miss some octave errors and cannot reliably identify absent or additional chord members. Do not convert ranking into calibrated confidence, precision or recall.
- Explicit unfolding and manual anchors handle known repeats/tempo drift. Recognition of the correct repeat occurrence or an unknown arrangement remains a review task.

## Not implemented

Automatic calibrated polyphonic transcription, reliable automatic arrangement identity, automatic PDF note truth, independently measured pedal/note-off recovery, or automatic production approval. An imported XML or a synthesized reference is not independent evidence of correctness against PDF/MP3.

## Unconfirmed without a real annotated reference

Real-song pitch/structure recall, false-positive rate and P95 alignment error. Controlled generated signals can test algorithms and gates but cannot establish those real-recording metrics. Keep missing results not_measured; never count abstention or gate rejection as successful detection.

This is release 1.1.0. Existing component defaults are retained; new formal exports require the current configuration, time-map and quality evidence. No private song media, annotations, fonts or personal avatars belong in the portable package.
